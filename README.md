# WordPress Admin UI

WordPress Admin UI is a super clean, gray and yellow colored admin panel theme with the ability to change the colors.

## Description

Wordpress's admin themes are great, but we wanted to take it a step further. This is a clean yellow/gray theme by default for the admin panel that simplifies the interface and makes things more accessible for our customers. Customize your colors by visiting Settings > General

If there are any features you'd like to see or bugs with other plugins - visit the support tab and let us know.

## Improvements made

* WP Admin Bar for front-end and back-end of the site
* Soft Gray menu
* Larger Calls to Action within Edit screens
* Ability to change custom primary / secondary colors
* Mobile Menu compatibility

## Installation

1. Upload `smartystudio-admin-ui` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Set your custom colors via Settings > General

Be sure to check your login page because the default WP logo is a light blue and doesn't match. I did wrap the standard WP logo in a white rounded rectangle so it should show up without any issue on any color.
